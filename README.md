# HousingPrice_Prediction
my solution for a take home assignement (company in the real estate industry)

The goal here is to predict and adjust the selling prices of houses/appartement given a number of features and their geospatial coordonates.

I choose to cluster the goods spatially using K-means and to predict the prices using Xgboost.
